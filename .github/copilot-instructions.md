This is a React + TypeScript + Vite project for a Cafeteria Orders system. Use React hooks, SCSS for styling, and follow modular, scalable, and clean code practices. TypeScript types and interfaces should be meaningful and enforced everywhere. Avoid class components. Use centralized API services for backend communication. Keep code clean and maintainable.
